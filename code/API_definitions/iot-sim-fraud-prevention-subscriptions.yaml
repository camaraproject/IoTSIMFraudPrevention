   API to create, with SIM card binding and unbinding and regional restriction

    # Introduction

    With this API, we need to subscribe to a SIM card binding service or regional restriction service first. Then, customers could use query api to query the binding information which returns match status. Also, customers could use bind api to bind the SIM card and IMEI together. When the IMEI reported in the message doesn't match the binding one, the network serices will be blocked automatically. When the IMEI reported in the message matches the binding one, the network service of the SIM card will be restored.
    The ability provided by the regional restriction is similar to that of SIM card binding, but what's bound is the regional information (the regional information is mapped to the corresponding region based on the base station ID reported in the message).

    # Relevant terms and definitions

    * **SIM card**: The SIM (subscriber identity module) card here stands for IoT（internet of things）network card.

    * **binding**: Machine card binding is a security management mechanism for IoT network cards, aimed at preventing them from being used for other purposes. By binding the SIM card to specific terminal devices, it ensures that the card can only be used on designated devices, thereby enhancing security.

    * **Device**: A device refers to any physical entity that can connect to a network and participate in network communication.

    * **IMEI**: IMEI stands for International Mobile Equipment Identity. It is a unique 15-digit number assigned to every mobile phone or cellular device, which is used to identify the device on a mobile network. The IMEI serves as a crucial identifier for tracking and managing mobile devices, particularly in cases of theft or loss. It can also be utilized for validating whether a device is authorized to connect to a network.

    # API Functionality

    The API defines one service endpoint:

    - `POST /subscribe` This API allows enterprise customers to subscribe to risk control information related to IoT SIM cards. When the device or region bound to the IoT card changes, the customer can be notified in a timely manner through the callback address registered by the customer, making it convenient for the customer to identify endpoint risks in a timely manner.
      - It is mandatory in the subscription to provide the event type for which the client would like to subscribe.
        - Following event ``types`` are managed for this API:
        - ``IMEI_CHANGE`` The triggle event when imei of device was changed

        - ``AREA_CHANGE`` The triggle event when area of device was changed
        - Note: Additionally to these list, ``SUBSCRIBE_END`` notification `type` is sent when the subscription ends. This notification does not require dedicated subscription.
          - It is used when:
             - the subscription expire time (optionally set by the requester) has been reached
             - the maximum number of subscription events (optionally set by the requester) has been reached
             - the subscription was deleted by the requester
             - the Access Token `sinkCredential` (optionally set by the requester) expiration time has been reached
             - the API server has to stop sending notification prematurely
      - Notification callback
        This endpoint describes the event notification received on subscription listener side when the event occurred.
        As for subscription, detailed description of the event notification is provided in the CAMARA API design guideline document.
      - _**WARNING**: This callback endpoint must be exposed on the consumer side as `POST /{$request.body#/sink}`.
      Developers may provide a callback URL on which notifications regarding geofencing can be received from the service provider.
      If an event occurs the application will send events to the provided webhook - 'sink'._

    To call this endpoint, the API consumer must first obtain a valid access token from the token endpoint, which is then passed as an Authorization header. When a 2-legged access token is used, the API consumer must also pass at least one of the available IoT subscription identifiers in the body of the request.
    The type of communication function is also needed in the body of the request.


    ## Error handling

    Errors may be returned for the following reasons. Note that this list is not exhaustive.

    `401 UNAUTHENTICATED`or `401 AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED`:
    - The access token is not a valid access token for the API provider
    - The access token was valid but has now expired

    `400 INVALID_ARGUMENT`:
    - The API request is not compliant with this OAS definition

    `400 OUT_OF_RANGE`:
    - A parameter value in the API request is outwith the range documented in this OAS definition for that parameter

    `404 IDENTIFIER_NOT_FOUND`:
    - The device identified by the `device` object in the request is not managed by the API provider

    `403 PERMISSION_DENIED`:
    - The access token does not have the required scope for the endpoint being called
    - The end user has not consented to the API consumer getting access to the device identifier information (2-legged access token only)

    `422 IDENTIFIER_MISMATCH`:
    - Multiple parameters have been provided in the `device` object, and these do not identify the same device

    `422 UNSUPPORTED_IDENTIFIER`:
    - A parameter provided in the `device` object is not supported by this implementation (e.g. `networkAccessIdentifier`)

    `422 UNNECESSARY_ACTIVATION`:
    `422 UNNECESSARY_DEACTIVATION`:
    - The specified communication function of the `device` has already be activated or deactivated but the corresponding operation type parameter was still provided

    `422 MISSING_IDENTIFIER`:
    `422 UNNECESSARY_IDENTIFIER`:
    - See the section "Identifying the device from the access token" below

    `429 QUOTA_EXCEEDED`:
    - The API consumer has used up the quota of API requests that they were allocated for this API

    `429 TOO_MANY_REQUESTS`:
    - The rate at which the API consumer is sending requests has exceeded that allowed by the API provider. Try again later.

    Other errors may be returned by implementations. These will have their usual meaning for the associated HTTP status codes.

    # Further info and support

    ## Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API provider, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

    ## Identifying the device from the access token

    This API requires the API consumer to identify a device as the subject of the API as follows:
    - When the API is invoked using a two-legged access token, the subject will be identified from the optional `device` object, which therefore MUST be provided.

    - When a three-legged access token is used however, this optional identifier MUST NOT be provided, as the subject will be uniquely identified from the access token.

    This approach simplifies API usage for API consumers using a three-legged access token to invoke the API by relying on the information that is associated with the access token and was identified during the authentication process.

    ### Error handling:
    - If the subject cannot be identified from the access token and the optional `device` object is not included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 MISSING_IDENTIFIER` error code.

    - If the subject can be identified from the access token and the optional `device` object is also included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 UNNECESSARY_IDENTIFIER` error code. This will be the case even if the same device is identified by these two methods, as the server is unable to make this comparison.

    Device:
      description: |
        End-user device able to connect to a mobile network. Examples of devices include smartphones or IoT sensors/actuators.

        The developer can choose to provide the below specified device identifiers:

        * `ipv4Address`
        * `ipv6Address`
        * `phoneNumber`
        * `networkAccessIdentifier`

        NOTE1: the API provider might support only a subset of these options. The API consumer can provide multiple identifiers to be compatible across different API providers. In this case the identifiers MUST belong to the same device
        NOTE2: as for this Commonalities release, we are enforcing that the networkAccessIdentifier is only part of the schema for future-proofing, and CAMARA does not currently allow its use. After the CAMARA meta-release work is concluded and the relevant issues are resolved, its use will need to be explicitly documented in the guidelines.

    PhoneNumber:
      description: A public identifier addressing a telephone subscription. In mobile networks it corresponds to the MSISDN (Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number). In order to be globally unique it has to be formatted in international format, according to E.164 standard, prefixed with '+'.
      type: string

      example: "+123456789"

    NetworkAccessIdentifier:
      description: A public identifier addressing a subscription in a mobile network. In 3GPP terminology, it corresponds to the GPSI formatted with the External Identifier ({Local Identifier}@{Domain Identifier}). Unlike the telephone number, the network access identifier is not subjected to portability ruling in force, and is individually managed by each operator.
      type: string
      example: "123456789@domain.com"

    DeviceIpv4Addr:
      type: object
      description: |
        The device should be identified by either the public (observed) IP address and port as seen by the application server, or the private (local) and any public (observed) IP addresses in use by the device (this information can be obtained by various means, for example from some DNS servers).

        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is not in use) then  the same address should be specified for both publicAddress and privateAddress.

        If NAT64 is in use, the device should be identified by its publicAddress and publicPort, or separately by its allocated IPv6 address (field ipv6Address of the Device object)

        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one of either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known. In general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4 address alone.

        publicAddress:
